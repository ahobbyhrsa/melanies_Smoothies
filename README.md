Harmonization and Standardization: How USCDI+ is Raising ..​

USCDI – United States Core Data for Interoperability ​

Being used for HRSA for quality ​

Also CMS is focused on quality …(when this dataset will be available) – working on dqms /FHIR based reporting for ecqms ​

Not a lot of alignment with how data elements are organized​

Need mechanism to make sure we aren’t duplicating efforts ​

Challenges:​

Equal distribution of resources ​

Still steps in process from patient/encounter into EHR then to healthcare ecosystem​

Hard to standardize workflow ​

Payment defines accountability and regulations​

Would like more clear guidance from ASTP​

NCI – informatics for cancer – semantic/common data element ​

Precision medicine studies​

Cancer immunology data commons ​

Want more effective research collaboration​

Developing FHIR IG guide for cancer ​

Clinical trials – extracted data from EHRs to send reports to FDA​

Data coordinating centers spend a lot of time cleaning data​

Challenges with interoperability ​

Cancer registry data collection is time consuming ​

Have 4 distinct use cases to try to find data elements that should be standardized ​

Many transformations and hope to eventually address this​

Starting planning a year aho​

​

CDC – branch chief for data standards​

Discussed mission​

How to achieve with good data​

Get data elements aligned so don’t increase burden​

Focused on aligning data with what exists already ​

Tied to minimum data necessary for publiv health response ​

HRSA​

HC facts​

Shared HRSA’s mission​

CBO – save money with health center program ​

Show the value of investing and to better understand the patients​

Challenges with UDS data with data entry errors​

Focused on standardization to reduce the burden since patients report to other agencies​

UDS+ - Shift from manual aggregate reporting /use USCDI standards and / FHIR based connection piloted / successfully piloted have 4 million patients​

Share that UDS+ updated got round of applause at ASTP Annual Meeting(BK)​

Public  ​

Data quality …have a ways to go ​

Some health centers have multiple EHRs and not all re interposable​

Be clear about requirements and give enough time for implementation ​

How using USCDI​

New data elements we want to collect with UDS Legacy data​

USCDI+ race/ethnicity data elements expanded and reduced burden on health centers​

Make sure data is capturable working with EHR vendors to improve this​

Opportunity to shift discussion for evaluation ​
